# Project-C

I have started my journey into C programming. This repository contains my practice codes and exercises.

## Learning Resource

* **Book:** Computer Programming (Part 1)
* **Author:** Tamim Shahriar Subeen
* **Buy on Rokomari:** [Click Here](https://www.rokomari.com/book/166987/computer-programming-1st-part)

---

##  Tools & Environment

I am currently learning and coding on an **Android** device using:

* **Terminal:** [Termux](https://termux.dev/)
* **Compiler:** `clang` 
* **Editor:** Nano / Micro / Vim

##  How to Run Code in Termux

To compile and run my C programs, I use the following commands:

```bash
# Compile
clang filename.c -o output

# Run
./output


### What was improved:
* **Termux Specifics:** Mentioned `clang` as the compiler, which is the standard for Termux.
* **Clean Links:** Turned the long Rokomari URL into a clickable "Click Here" link for a tidier look.
* **Universal Formatting:** Used standard Markdown so it looks great on GitHub, GitLab, or any other platform.

Would you like me to add a small **"Cheat Sheet"** section for common Termux shortcuts (like how to save or exit the editor)?
